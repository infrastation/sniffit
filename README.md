1. HELP THIS PROJECT
--------------------

Sniffit needs your help. **If you are a programmer** and if you want to
help a nice project, this is your opportunity.

My name is Eriberto and **I am not a C developer**. I imported Sniffit from
Internet to GitHub (the original homepage and developer are inactive).
After this, I applied all patches found in Debian project and other
places for this program. All my initial work was registered in CHANGELOG
file (version 0.4.0 and later releases). I also maintain Sniffit packaged
in Debian[1].

If you are interested to help Sniffit, read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

2. I AND SNIFFIT
----------------

Well, sniffit is a very old packet sniffer, originally developed by
Brecht Claerhout, between 1996 and 1998. This was the first program
that I compiled in GNU/Linux (in 1997). So, I have a special fondness for
this program. So, since 2015 I have maintained it as a package in Debian.
Since November 2016 I am trying to maintain it in GitHub but I need help!
Please, help this project (see above how to do it).


-------------------
3. WHAT IS SNIFFIT?
-------------------

sniffit is a packet sniffer for TCP/UDP/ICMP packets over IPv4. It is able
to give you a very detailed technical info on these packets, as SEQ, ACK, TTL,
Window, etc. The packet contents also can be viewed, in different formats
(hex or plain text, etc.).

sniffit was originally developed by Brecht Claerhout. The initial homepage, now offline, was
[here](http://reptile.rug.ac.be/~coder/sniffit/sniffit.html).

4. BUILDING FROM SOURCE
-----------------------

Run `./autogen.sh` to create the configure script, then run
```
./configure
make
make install
```

This program requires libpcap, it also uses libncurses if available.
